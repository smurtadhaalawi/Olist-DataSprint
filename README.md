# Olist-DataSprint
This project explores Brazil’s e-commerce ecosystem, focusing on Olist’s marketplace model, seller acquisition, and performance dynamics between resellers and manufacturers. It includes research on e-commerce trends, regulatory requirements, seller evaluation strategies, and a full analytical assessment of seller performance.

## What is e-commerce and the B2B model Olist implements
From the main page of Olist you can see that Olist "is an e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online."




## Scenario: Seller Vetting & Scoring System**

As Olist continues to expand its marketplace ecosystem, the company faces increasing challenges in **recruiting reliable and high-quality sellers**. With thousands of new sellers applying each month, the existing onboarding process struggles to identify which sellers are likely to succeed and which may become operational risks. Issues such as delayed shipping, inaccurate product information, poor packaging, and inconsistent pricing have begun to affect customer satisfaction and platform reputation.

At the same time, Brazil’s e-commerce environment is becoming more regulated. Requirements related to **consumer protection (CDC), tax compliance (CNPJ validation), product traceability, warranty rules**, and marketplace responsibilities place additional pressure on Olist to ensure that all sellers comply with legal standards before being onboarded.

To address these challenges, Olist plans to implement a **Seller Vetting & Scoring System**—a structured framework that evaluates sellers *before* they are approved. The goal is to ensure that only sellers with strong operational capacity, legal compliance, high product quality, and competitive pricing become part of the marketplace.

The challenge is to determine **which information and metrics** should be used to evaluate and score applicants. The scoring system must balance **regulatory compliance**, **data-driven insights**, and **business performance indicators**, ensuring that Olist selects sellers who will deliver consistent service and contribute positively to overall marketplace performance.

The evaluation should incorporate:

* **Business profile verification:** CNPJ status, tax compliance, official registration, business age.
* **Operational readiness:** shipping performance, inventory capacity, response times, logistics setup.
* **Product quality indicators:** defect rates, return ratio, warranty compliance, category expertise.
* **Customer experience metrics:** past ratings, review patterns, complaint history (e.g., ReclameAqui).
* **Pricing behavior:** price competitiveness, discount consistency, margin stability.
* **Regulatory adherence:** compliance with consumer protection laws, proper labeling, authenticity proof.
* **Historical performance (if existing seller):** revenue trends, cancellation rates, SLA compliance.

This scenario forms the foundation for developing a robust Seller Vetting & Scoring System that protects Olist’s brand, improves marketplace trust, and ensures long-term seller success.
